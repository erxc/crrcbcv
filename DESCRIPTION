Description: 
  A user friendly function 'crrcbcv' to compute bias-corrected variances for competing risks regression models using proportional subdistribution hazards with small-sample clustered data. Four types of bias correction are included: the MD-type bias correction by Mancl and DeRouen (2001), the KC-type bias correction by Kauermann and Carroll (2001), the FG-type bias correction by Fay and Graubard (2001), and the MBN-type bias correction by Morel, Bokossa, and Neerchal (2003).
